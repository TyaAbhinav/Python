# Python
In week 2 we begin programming. This week we get started with variables and assignment, data structures and documentation.
In week 3 we build on this and look at loops, functions, modules and packages.
In week 4 we wrap up basic Python coding with error handling, object oriented programming and tests.
In week 5 we bring all these techniques together and write useful scripts, first for logging and then we start writing network code.
